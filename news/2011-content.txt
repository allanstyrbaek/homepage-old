My very first article
=====================
:date:`March, 1988 (not a typo)`

While searching my computer for some files, I stumbled upon my very first
article that I published in March 1988 when I was 16. It was in a French
quaterly magazine dedicated to Apple and I sent a program in Apple Basic that
was magnifying some part of the screen on Apple IIe/IIc.

Interview
=========
:date:`Septembre 20, 2011`

I got interviewed by Françoise Breton for INRIA website.

*Nicolas Rougier, membre de l’équipe Cortex (Nancy), s’intéresse au
fonctionnement du cerveau. Il cherche à comprendre l’émergence de phénomènes
aussi complexes que la cognition ou la conscience. Une démarche dans laquelle
la modélisation est primordiale, le recours à la robotique est courant, et la
reproduction fidèle des grands principes biologiques est un souci permanent.*

Freetype-gl on OpenGL.org
=========================
:date:`August 01, 2011`

*« Combining Freetype with a contour rendering method based on distance fields,
Nicolas Rougier has created a library to display infinitely scalable
anti-aliased text in OpenGL. The library, simply called freetype-gl, is BSD
licensed and can be used in commercial products. This is a way to finally get
rid of pixelated and blurred text in real time content. The rendering technique
extends to monochrome line art in general, although this particular library is
aimed specifically at rendering Freetype fonts. Code and more information
available online. »*

Yeah !

The best poster I've ever made
==============================
:date:`August, 2011`

.. image:: ../thumbnails/glumpy.png

   :target: ../images/glumpy.pdf

I've made this poster for the EuroScipy conference in Paris, 2011. I made it
using the Comic Life software available on MacOS (with a trial period of 30
days). It took me only 2/3 days to make it. The good point is that the poster
attracted a lot of people. The drawback is that one question out of two was
"Hey, how did you made that cool poster ?"

Anyway, I would recommend to anyone. It's lot of fun.

Zoé finished her training period and here is the final result. The goal was to
design a simple poster to explain research in Computer Science to kids in
junior high schools.
