Here are some current and former projects I'm currently involved, with some
official support ($$$) or not, it is not really a criterion, even if money
helps.

Braincraft
==========

**2015 (associated team)**

What are the processes by which animals and humans select their actions based
on their motiva- tions and on the consequences of past actions? This is a
fundamental question in neuroscience, with implications to ethology,
psychology, economics, sociology and computer science. The basal ganglia are a
group of interconnected subcortical nuclei which have been the subject of
intensive studies in the past years, both at the computational, psychological,
anatomical and biological levels (Alexander, 1986; Mink, 1996; Gurney et al,
2001, Leblois 2006). From study of the basal ganglia’s dysfunctions
(e.g. neuro-degenerative diseases), these nuclei are believed to play a
prominent role in action selection, choosing, among possible actions, to
trigger the one with the best expectancy of achievement, with regard to the
goal to be fulfilled. The place for the representation of actions and of their
contingencies with regard to motor and sensory constraints is the prefrontal
cortex, in charge of the temporal organization of behavior (O’Reilly et al,
2006). The prefrontal cortex is consequently at the crossroad of two kinds of
loops, with other cortical regions giving sensorimotor constraints from the
environment and with the basal ganglia giving reinforcement constraints in
terms of goal achievement.

Dopamine control of a novel basal ganglia cell-type
===================================================

**2014 (PEPS Idex)**

The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) plays a key role in basal ganglia (BG)
circuits. However, despite the fundamental importance of DA in those circuits,
the electrophysiological effects of dopamine on target neurons are largely
unknown. Furthermore, contrary to classical models that only view the globus
pallidus (GP) as a relay station of the indirect pathway, we have discovered a
novel GP cell-type called the Arkypallidal (Arky-GP) neurons that only project
to striatum in a very dense way. Arky-GP cells represent a novel BG pathway
that might contribute massively to the GABAergic inhibition in striatum. In
this project, we would like to explore for the first time whether DA has a
direct action on Arky-GP neurons through D2 DA receptors. To do so, we propose
a high risk/high gain project based on multidisciplinary approaches
(anatomical, in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulation, and
computational modeling) that bring together 3 researchers with different but
complementary expertise.

Basal Ganglia At Large
======================

**2013 (associated team)**

Many computational models of the litterature integrates a wealth of data from
neuroscience. From the analysis of their performances, several principles of
cerebral mechanisms related to decision making have been derived, often
corroborated by experiments in neuroscience and medicine. Nevertheless, most of
these modeling approaches have characteristics that bring important limitations
with regard to the real brain. Firstly, the size of the networks is generally
small (typically, each neuronal structure is represented by a few neurons,
instead of millions in the real brain). While this is satisfactory to validate
principles of functioning, this might prevent from observing large scale
effects (eg. noise, spontaneous activity, emerging properties) and from
applying the model to realistic tasks involving multiple and large information
flows. Secondly, models are generally developed and assessed as an
implementation of a cerebral function and are not considered as a biologically
plausible implementation of a neuronal computation. As a consequence some
intrinsic limitations at this level (eg. model not extendable to largest
scales, not fully distributed and including bottleneck in the circulation of
information) will not be detected and corrected. Even if a lot remains to be
done to understand the complexity of the brain organization, we believe that
the domain is mature enough, with well-established models and well-recognized
principles of information processing, to attack a new aspect of numerical
simulation, with the implementation of neuronal models at a large scale.

Vispy
=====

**2013** (not funded, active)

Vispy is an OpenGL-based interactive visualization library in Python. Its goal
is to make it easy to create beautiful and fast dynamic visualizations. For
example, scientific plotting of tens of millions of points, interacting with
complex polygonial models, and (dynamic) volume rendering. All thanks to the
graphics card’s hardware acceleration. The core development team consists of
Luke Campagnola, Almar Klein, Nicolas Rougier and Cyrille Rossant. We have each
written our own Python visualization toolkit (PyQtGraph, Visvis, Glumpy and
Galry, respectively), and decided to team-up around this project.

**2011** (not funded, active)

`PsyPhiNe
<http://www.msh-lorraine.fr/recherche/axe-6-sciences-et-cognition/groupe-psyphine.html>`_
is an ongoing project between philosophers, psychologists and computer
scientists. The goal of the project is related to cognition and behavior but is
not yet settled since it took us two years just to make us understood and share
a common vocabulary.

Formet projects
===============

* **Cortina associated team (2011-2013)**. Much progress has been made in the
  last decades in understanding the basic organization and function of the
  nervous system in general. Contributions to this end have come from various
  domains including computational neuroscience and numerical science of the
  information in general. The goal of this associate team is to combine our
  complementary expertise, from experimental biology and mathematical models (U
  de Valparaiso and U Federico Santa-Maria) to computational neuroscience
  (Mnemosyne and NeuroMathComp), in order to develop common tools for the analysis
  and formalization of neural coding and related sensory-motor loops.

* **CNRS/PEPII on action selection**.  In
  collaboration with the Institute of Neurodegenerative diseases (IMN,
  Bordeaux), Supélec (Metz), we have been investigating a computational model
  of the basal ganglia.

* **CNRS/PEPII on IMAVO (2011-2012)**.  In collaboration with the Center of
  Integrative and Cognitive Neurosciences, Bordeaux, the MAIA team (INRIA Nancy
  Grand Est) and the Institute of Intelligent System and Robototics (ISIR,
  Paris) we have been investigating effect on non-stationary environment in
  learning.

* **CNRS/PEPS on reinforcement learning (2008-2010)**.
  In collaboration with the Center of Integrative and Cognitive Neurosciences,
  Bordeaux, MAIA team (INRIA, Nancy) and Supelec (Metz), we are developing bio-
  inspired reinforcement learning procedures, on the basis of experimental data
  from behavioural recordings in rats.

* **MAPS (2007-2011)** is an ANR project in collaboration with UMR "Mouvement
  et Perception", Marseille, INCM-CNRS, Marseille and LIRIS, Lyon, centered
  around the notion of spatial computation that aims at re- examining the
  relationship between structure and function, taking into account the
  topological (spatial aspects) and hodological (connectivity) constraints of
  the neuronal substrate.

* **MirrorBot, IST-FET European Project (2002-2006)**.
  In collaboration with the University of Parma (Italy, V.Gallese,
  G.Rozzolati),the University of Ulm (Germary, P. Günter), the University of
  Sunderland (United Kingdom, S. Wermter, coordinator) and the medical research
  council (United Kingdom, F. Pulvermüller), we developed an approach of
  biomimetic multimodal learning us- ing a mirror-neuron-based robot to
  investigate the task of foraging for objects. This task involved the search
  for objects and integrated multimodal sensory inputs to plan and guide
  behaviour. We examined these per- ceptual processes using models of cortical
  assemblies and mirror neurons to explore the emergence of semantic
  representations of actions, percepts, language and concepts in a MirrorBot, a
  biologically-inspired neural robot. The main hypothesis was to investigate
  whether a mirror neuron-based cell assembly model is able to produce a
  life-like perception system for actions.

* **CorTexMex (2008-2012)** is an associated team between INRIA Cortex project,
  INAOE and Universidad Politecnica de Victoria for the hardware/software
  codesign of bio-inspired connectionist models for vision using biologically
  plausible models of visual perception by understanding, modelling and
  simulating the mechanisms that underlie neural processes in the brain.

* **CPER, Teleoperation and Intelligent Assistants, 2003-2006**. In the
  framework of the Contrat de Plan Etat Région, we contributed to the project
  whose goal is to study systems for the monitoring of industrial
  processes. More speci􏰀cally, our role was to develop a biologically inspired
  connectionist system for visual perception and to integrate it on an
  autonomous robot.

* **Project Robea of the CNRS - Learning of visiomotor transformations (2003-2004)**.
  In collaboration with Supelec-Metz, INSERM-Paris and EDF-Chatou, this project
  proposed a generic neuronal methodology inspired from the modular cortical
  architecture to learn complex visiomotor loops, with application to
  manipulation, reaching and grasping tasks for complex robots.  6

* **CNRS Specific Action: Perceptive supply and interface (2002-2004)**.
  The aim of the "Perceptive supply and interface" project was to set up a
  theoretical ergonomy of assisting devices for people with perceptive
  disabilities. The laboratories involved in this specific action of the CNRS
  STIC department were : Costech/BIM (E.A. 2223/UMR 6600, Compiègne), ETIS
  (Upress-A 8051, Cergy), Institut de Sciences Cognitives (UMR 5015, Lyon),
  Neurophysique et Physiologie du Système Moteur (FRE 2361, Paris V),
  Laboratoire de Psychologie Expérimentale (UMR 8581, ParisV), Préhistoire et
  Technique (UMR 7055, ParisX) and Psy.Co (E.A. 1780, Rouen)
