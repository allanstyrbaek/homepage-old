Welcome
=======

I'm Nicolas Rougier and you're currently browsing my website. I'm a full-time
research scientist at `INRIA <http://www.inria.fr>`_ which is the French
National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control. This is a
public scientific and technological establishment (EPST) under the double
supervision of the Research & Education Ministry, and the Ministry of Economy
Finance and Industry. I'm working within the `MNEMOSYNE
<http://team.inria.fr/mnemosyne/>`_ project which lies at the frontier between
integrative and computational neuroscience in association with the `Institute
of Neurodegenerative Diseases <http://imn-bordeaux.org/index.php?lang=en>`_.

Thanks for visiting and enjoy the site.
