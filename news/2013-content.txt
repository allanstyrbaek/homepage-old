**Abstract** Dashed stroked paths are a widely-used feature found in the vast
majority of vector-drawing software and libraries. They enable, for example,
the highlighting of a given path, such as the current selection, in drawing
software or distinguishing curves, in the case of a scientific plotting
package. This paper introduces a shader-based method for rendering arbitrary
dash patterns along any continuous polyline (smooth or broken). The proposed
method does not tessellate individual dash patterns and allows for fast and
nearly accurate rendering of any user-defined dash pattern and caps. Benchmarks
indicate a slowdown ratio between 1.1 and 2.1 with an increased memory
consumption between 3 and 6. Furthermore, the method can be used for solid
thick polylines with correct caps and joins with only a slowdown factor of 1.1.

Intelligent systems require a body to interact with the environment depending
on the context. This apparently simple proposal has strong implications for the
understanding of living organisms in their complexity, but also for anyone who
wants to design robots closer to living organisms in the way they
operate. Around the themes presented in `The Simplexity

Vispy 0.2.0
===========
:date:`November 4, 2013`

I'm pleased to announce that we've just released Vispy 0.2 !

Please have a go and try it out: http://vispy.org

In this release we improved the OpenGL object-oriented interface. You
can find a few examples here: http://vispy.org/gallery.html

The next step for us is to design higher-level visualization
interfaces. Those will let users not necessarily familiar with OpenGL
design beautiful and fast visualizations in Python (including data
visualization and scientific plotting).

Please report bugs and feature requests at our issue tracker:
https://github.com/vispy/vispy/issues

Vispy will be at the Budapest BI Forum this week! http://budapestbiforum.com/

Cerveau et Informatique (French)
================================
:date:`November 4, 2013`

I'll give a talk at the Université Paul Sabatier for the `Brain and Computer
Science <../downloads/ProgrammeJourneeSISA.pdf>`_ conference.

**Abstract** The visual exploration of a scene involves the interplay of
several competiting processes (for example to select the next saccade or to
keep fixation) and the integration of bottom-up (e.g. contrast) and top-down
information (the target of a visual search task). Identifying the neural
mechanisms involved in these processes and the integration of these information
remain a challenging question. After briefly reviewing psychological and
physiological data on visual attention, I'll explain what it actually means to
model visual attention in computational neuroscience and what can be learnt from
these models.

Georgios's defense
==================

:date:`October 23, 2013` Georgios Is. Detorakis, *Cortical plasticity, dynamic
neural fields and self-organization*

**Abstract.** The aim of the present work is the modeling of the formation,
maintenance and reorganization of somatosensory cortical maps using the theory
of dynamic neural fields. A dynamic neural field is a partial
integro-differential equation that is used to model the cortical activity of a
part of the cortex. Such a neural field is used in this work in order to model
a part of the area 3b of the primary somatosensory cortex. In addition a skin
model is used in order to provide input to the cortical model. From a
computational point of view the model is able to perform distributed, numerical
and adaptive computations. The model is able to explain the formation of
topographic maps and their reorganization in the presence of a cortical lesion
or a sensory deprivation, where balance between excitation and inhibition plays
a crucial role. In addition, the model is consistent with neurophysiological
data of area 3b. Finally, it has been shown that attention plays a key role in
the organization of receptive fields of neurons of the somatosensory
cortex. Therefore, in this work has been proposed a definition of somatosensory
attention and a potential explanation of its influence on somatotopic
organization through a number of experimental results. By changing the gains of
lateral connections, it is possible to control the shape of the solution of the
neural field. This leads to significant alterations of receptive fields sizes,
resulting to a better performance during the execution of demanding haptic
tasks.

ISN Day (French)
================
:date:`June 27, 2013`

I gave a talk about cyber-criminality at the *Journées pédagogiques sur ISN*
(in French).

**Résumé** Depuis les heures glorieuses du "phreaking" où des adolescents
cherchaient simplement à téléphoner gratuitement (1960), jusqu'à la mise au
point par des états de virus informatiques pour des attaques ciblées (2010), le
visage de la cybercriminalité s'est radicalement transformé en l'espace de
quelques années. Là où l'on trouvait des passionés d'informatique, on trouve
aujourd'hui des états, des industries, des mafias et des "script kiddies". Les
possibilités de piratage et de fraude se sont par ailleurs multipliées depuis
la généralisation de l'accès à internet et de la téléphonie mobile. Sachant que
le point d'entrée privilégié dans un système est l'utilisateur lambda, il est
plus que jamais nécessaire de rester vigilant.

Higher Quality 2D Text Rendering
================================
:date:`April 2, 2013`

**Abstract** Even though text is pervasive in most 3D applications, there is
surprisingly no native support for text rendering in OpenGL. To cope with this
absence, Mark Kilgard introduced the use of texture fonts. This technique is
well know and widely used and ensures both good performances and a decent
quality in most situations. However, the quality may degrade strongly in
orthographic mode (screen space) due to pixelation effects at large sizes and
to legibility problems at small sizes due to incorrect hinting and positioning
of glyph. I propose to revisit font texture rendering to ensure the highest
quality in orthographic mode. The method allows for both the accurate rendering
and positioning of any glyph on the screen. While the method is compatible with
complex shaping and/or layout (e.g., Arabic alphabet), these specific cases are
not studied in this article.

PhD Position
============
:date:`March 14, 2013`

The aim of this proposal is to investigate and to model decision making at
different levels in order to establish the link between motor primitives and
higher level actions. The question is to understand how continuous complex
motor sequences can be dynamically represented as actions such that they can be
later manipulated to resolve conflict when several actions are possible.

This research will take place at the institute of neurodegenerative diseases
whose goal is to develop therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative diseases
using both vertical and translational approaches. More specifically, this
research will be driven in cooperation with the Basal Gang group which has
extended expertise in the physiology of decision making and the neuromodulation
of the cortex-basal ganglia loop.

The candidate should have education in mathematics and computer science
(modeling, differential equations, simulation, analysis) with a strong
motivation or experience in neurosciences.
