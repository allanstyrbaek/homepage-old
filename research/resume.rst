Research topics
---------------

The brain is an extraordinary complex organ that has been the subject of an
intense research for the past centuries and during the past few decades, major
breakthroughs have advanced our understanding of some of its underlying neural
dynamics and interactions. Yet, the understanding of higher brain functions
continues to be an outstanding challenge. My research activities attempt to
understand these higher brain function using computational models. These models
are grounded on a computational paradigm that is directly inspired by several
brain studies converging on a *distributed, asynchronous, numerical and
adaptive processing of information* with a special emphasis on the brain-body
interaction, i.e. embodied cognition.
