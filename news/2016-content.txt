Scientific Python course (advanced)
===================================
:date:`March 17-18, 2016`

This course aims at introducing advanced concepts of the scientific Python
eco‐system (numpy, scipy, cython, git, OpenGL). It is intended for those with
some experience of Python and basic knowledge of the scientific stack. Note
that this course requires some material to be pre‐installed on your computer.

Scientific Python course (beginner)
===================================
:date:`March 14-15, 2016`

This course gives an introduction to the Python scientific ecosystem (numpy,
matplotlib) and is intended primarily for those with little or no previous
familiarity with Python, though those with prior experience of the language
might pick up some useful tips. No requirements but a computer (any system).

We developed a model of the basal ganglia (Piron et al., 2016) that introduces
an action selection mechanism that is based upon the competition between a
positive feedback through the direct pathway and a negative feedback through
the hyperdirect pathway. The model also exploits the parallel organization of
circuits between the basal ganglia and the cortex using segregated loops: one
loop allows to choose the cue and one loop allows to make the actual motor
selection. Learning occurs between the cognitive cortex and the cognitive
striatum using a simple reinforcement learning where the values of the
different cues are updated after each decision. As in most computational models
of the basal ganglia, this model relies on an actor-critic architecture where
the dopamine signal is used to encode the temporal difference prediction error
signal in the critic (Joel et al., 2002; Khamassi et al., 2005). However, this
algorithm is not very elaborated and its implementation is not biologically
plausible since values are stored outside the model. The objectives of this
postdoc is thus to review and to re-implement (Python) main actor-critic models
of the literature in order to compare them on a common set of decision tasks
(two-arm bandit task for example) in terms of biological plausibility and
performances. Special attention will be given to the "Primary Value and Learned
Value Pavlovian Learning Algorithm" model (O'Reilly, 2007) and the AGREL model
(Roefselma et al. 2005). From these replications (that will be published in
`ReScience <http://rescience.github.io>`_), the most plausible and compatible
mechanisms will be implemented in our own model of the basal ganglia in order
to replace the current reinforcement learning algorithm (Guthrie et al., 2013,
Piron et al. 2016).

Resolving a Long-Standing Paradox
=================================
:date:`February 22, 2016`

| **The globus pallidus pars interna in goal oriented and habitual behavior. Resolving an old standing paradox**.

**Background**: There is an apparent contradiction between experimental data
showing that the basal ganglia are involved in goal-oriented and routine
behaviors and clinical observations. Lesion or disruption by deep brain
stimulation of the globus pallidus interna has been used for various
therapeutic purposes ranging from the improvement of dystonia to the treatment
of Tourette’s syndrome. None of these approaches has reported any severe
impairment in goal-oriented or automatic movement. **Method**: To solve this
conundrum, we trained 2 monkeys to perform a variant of a 2-armed bandit-task
(with different reward contingencies). In the latter we alternated blocks of
trials with choices between familiar rewarded targets that elicit routine
behavior and blocks with novel pairs of targets that require an intentional
learning process. **Results**: Bilateral inactivation of the globus pallidus
interna, by injection of muscimol, prevents animals from learning new
contingencies while performance remains intact, although slower for the
familiar stimuli. We replicate in silico these data by adding lateral
competition and Hebbian learning in the cortical layer of the theoretical model
of the cortex–basal ganglia loop that provided the framework of our
experimental approach. **Conclusion**: The basal ganglia play a critical role
in the deliberative process that underlies learning but are not necessary for
the expression of routine movements. Our approach predicts that after
pallidotomy or during stimulation, patients should have difficulty with complex
decision-making processes or learning new goal-oriented behaviors.

The vain dream of electronic immortality
========================================
:date:`January 5, 2016`

  "In just over 30 years, humans will be able to upload their entire minds to
  computers and become digitally immortal. – Ray Kurzweil, Global Futures 2045
  International Congress (2013)

Without even considering the ethical, philosophical, social or legal scope of
such a statement, it’s important to consider if it actually makes any sense. To
try to give an educated guess, we have to move away from computer science and
look at what biology and neuroscience can teach us.
