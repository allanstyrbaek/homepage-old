I created the Baby Tux in 2003 for my gnubiff software because I wanted to have
some animation saying "you've got mail". The result was a cute jumping baby tux
that was made using constructive solid geometry (CSG) and some macros borrowed
from Rune S. Johansen and Chris Colefax. Later, in 2005, I wanted to learn
Blender so I tried to model the baby GNU.  Alain Dutech recently re-designed
the baby Tux in Blender, starting from scratch with the help of the original
Povray file. We made them 3d printed, aren't they cute ?

DANA: Distributed numerical and adaptive modelling
==================================================
:date:`December 3, 2012`

*DANA: Distributed numerical and adaptive modelling framework*, Nicolas
P. Rougier, Jérémy Fix, **Network: Computation in Neural Systems** 2012,
Vol. 23, No. 4 , Pages 237-253

**Abstract.** DANA is a python framework whose computational paradigm is
grounded on the notion of a unit that is essentially a set of time dependent
values varying under the influence of other units via adaptive weighted
connections. The evolution of a unit's value are defined by a set of
differential equations expressed in standard mathematical notation which
greatly ease their definition. The units are organized into groups that form a
model. Each unit can be connected to any other unit (including itself) using a
weighted connection. The DANA framework offers a set of core objects needed to
design and run such models. The modeler only has to define the equations of a
unit as well as the equations governing the training of the connections. The
simulation is completely transparent to the modeler and is handled by
DANA. This allows DANA to be used for a wide range of numerical and distributed
models as long as they fit the proposed framework (e.g. cellular automata,
reaction-diffusion system, decentralized neural networks, recurrent neural
networks, kernel-based image processing, etc.).

Corps & Robots (French)

La théorie de la cognition incarnée nous a enseigné, il y a maintenant quelques
années, que l'évolution d'un modèle dans le monde réel (sous forme d'un corps
robotique) lui donne un accès direct et privilégié aux lois qui régissent ce
même monde. Nul besoin de modéliser les lois de la gravité, le modèle s'y
trouvera de facto confronté s'il essaye de prendre son envol depuis le haut
d'un escalier. Nul besoin de connaître les lois de frottements entre deux
solides, le modèle ne pourra de toute façon jamais réaliser une commande
parfaite de roulement sur un sol irrégulier.

Or, si cette théorie de l'incarnation représente aujourd'hui une des voies
privilégiées pour l'exploration et la compréhension de la cognition, elle
semble difficile à appréhender dans le cadre des nouveaux dispositifs
technologiques qui sont apparus au cours de ces dernières années. Ainsi, les
appartements dits intelligents viennent bouleverser la notion de corps en
proposant des appartements instrumentalisés permettant d'interagir avec
eux. Mais quel type de cognition peut alors émerger de cette étrange
confrontation au réel ? De même, les interfaces cerveaux-ordinateurs viennent
brouiller les cartes en ce sens qu'une partie de la cognition est assurée par
un cerveau humain alors qu'une autre partie relève de la machine et doit se
développer en symbiose. Mais qui doit s'adapter à l'autre alors ?

Ces nouvelles possibilités de confrontation au réel pour les modèles offrent
donc de nouvelles perspectives à la fois dans le champ de l'intelligence
artificielle et dans celui de la philosophie. Nous proposons donc de discuter
autour de ces questions au travers des interventions de modélisateurs et de
philosophes.

Wahiba's defense

:date:`September 26, 2012` Wahiba Taouali, *Modélisation de populations
neuronales pour l'intégration visuo-motrice: Dynamiques et Décisions*

**Abstract.** Within the context of enaction and a global approach to
perception, we focused on the characteristics of neural computation necessary
to understand the relationship between structures in the brain and their
functions. We first considered computational problems related to the
discretization of differential equations that govern the studied systems and
the synchronous and asynchronous evaluation schemes. Then, we investigated a
basic functional level : the transformation of spatial sensory representations
into temporal motor actions within the visual-motor system. We focused on the
visual flow from the retina to the superior colliculus to propose a minimalist
model of automatic encoding of saccades to visual targets. This model, based on
simple local rules (CNFT and logarithmic projection) in a homogeneous
population and using a sequential processing, reproduces and explains several
results of biological experiments. It is then considered as a robust and
efficient basic model. Finally, we investigated a more general functional level
by proposing a computational model of the basal ganglia motor loop. This model
integrates sensory, motor and motivational flows to perform a global decision
based on local assessments. We implemented an adaptive process for action
selection and context encoding through an innovative mechanism that allows to
form the basic circuit for other cortico-basal loops. This mechanism allows to
create internal repre- sentations according to the enactive approach that
opposes the computer metaphor of the brain. Both models have interesting
dynamics to study from whether a biological point of view or a computational
numerical one.

John Hunter 1968-2012
=====================

:date:`August 28, 2012` John Hunter, author of Matplotlib, founding board
member of NumFOCUS, husband to Miriam, and father to three daughters: Clara,
Ava, and Rahel, was diagnosed with cancer in late July 2012 after returning
from his keynote address at SciPy in Austin, TX. He passed away on August 28th
from complications arising from necessary cancer treatment. It’s a very sad
day. John’s work has been a never ending source of beauty and inspiration.
Rest in peace, John, you will be `missed <http://numfocus.org/johnhunter/>`_.

Matplotlib tutorial
===================
:date:`August 10, 2012`

Matplotlib tutorial for Euroscipy 2012 is available at this `address
<http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/>`_. Matplotlib is probably
the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very
quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many
formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most
common cases. This tutorial is based on Mike Müller's tutorial available from
the scipy lecture notes. All code and material is licensed under a Creative

Plos ONE
========
:date:`July 12, 2012`

G.Is. Detorakis, N.P. Rougier, *A Neural Field Model of the Somatosensory
Cortex: Formation, Maintenance and Reorganization of Ordered Topographic Maps*,
**PLoS** ONE 7(7), 2012, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0040257

**Abstract.** We investigate the formation and maintenance of ordered
topographic maps in the primary somatosensory cortex as well as the
reorganization of representations after sensory deprivation or cortical
lesion. We consider both the critical period (postnatal) where representations
are shaped and the post-critical period where representations are maintained
and possibly reorganized. We hypothesize that feed-forward thalamocortical
connections are an adequate site of plasticity while cortico-cortical
connections are believed to drive a competitive mechanism that is critical for
learning. We model a small skin patch located on the distal phalangeal surface
of a digit as a set of 256 Merkel ending complexes (MEC) that feed a
computational model of the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b). This model
is a two-dimensional neural field where spatially localized solutions
(a.k.a. bumps) drive cortical plasticity through a Hebbian-like learning
rule. Simulations explain the initial formation of ordered representations
following repetitive and random stimulations of the skin patch. Skin lesions as
well as cortical lesions are also studied and results confirm the possibility
to reorganize representations using the same learning rule and depending on the
type of the lesion. For severe lesions, the model suggests that
cortico-cortical connections may play an important role in complete recovery.
