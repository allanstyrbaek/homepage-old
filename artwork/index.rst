Scientific illustrations
========================

Here are some scientific illustrations I've made (or contributed to) over the
years for various journals, events or medias. Some have not been made by me but
largely use some of my graphics.

Neurosciences
=============

I've created those graphics for various conferences (NeuroComp, Workshop on a
Multidisciplinary approach to the study of Frontal Cortex, Computational
Cognitive Neuroscience) and some of them have been used as well for books,
journals (PloS Biology, Berkeley Science Review), wikipedia entries or simple
lessons.  Feel free to use them. Some higher resolution version are also
available. Source for neuron scheme is available as a `svg file
<../images/neuron.svg>`_. The Matrix neuron is also available at `higher (6400x4800)
<../images/NeuronMatrix-6400x4800.png>`_ resolution.

Baby Tux & Baby GNU
===================

I originally  created the Baby  Tux in 2003  for my gnubiff software  because I
wanted to have  some animation saying "you've got mail". The  result was a cute
jumping baby tux that was made using constructive solid geometry (CSG) and some
macros borrowed  from Rune S. Johansen  and Chris Colefax. The  render has been
done using  Povray, a  great and free  raytracer. Later,  in 2005, I  wanted to
learn Blender so I tried to model the baby GNU and exported it to
povray.

Sources are available `here <../downloads/gnu-tux.tgz>`_ (43Mo). Higher resolution of
the Gnu/Tux soft revolution are also available as `jpeg
<../images/GnuTuxSoftRevolution-v2-Big.jpg>`_ (5Mo, 4028x9369) and `pdf

Here are SVG versions for the baby GNU and baby Tux.

Thanks to Alain Dutech who re-modeled the tux, here are 3D printed baby GNU &
baby TUX, aren't they cute ?

The Ancient Art of Go
=====================

Here are some images related to the ancient art of go. They've been produced
using povray and solid constructive geometry. The hardest part was certainly
goban feet which possess a very peculiar shape.

Some wallpapers dedicated the GNOME desktop environemnt which is quite a nice
desktop environment.  You can find accompanying splash screens at

(Artistic) Nudes
================

As the title above suggests, those are (artistic) nudes that may be not
suitable to be seen at work even if most today commercials usually display more
nudity.
