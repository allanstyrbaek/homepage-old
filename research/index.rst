==================
Research interests
==================

The brain is an extraordinary and complex organ that has been the subject of an
intense research for the past centuries and during the past few decades, major
breakthroughs have advanced our understanding of some of its underlying neural
dynamics and interactions. Yet, the understanding of higher brain functions
continues to be an outstanding challenge.

Computational Neuroscience
==========================

My research activities in the domain of computational neurosciences attempt to
understand these higher brain function using computational models. I've
recently investigated **visual attention** in order to understand what are the
inner mechanisms of occular saccades. More recently, I've investigated the
self-organization of representations within the primary **somato-sensory
cortex** and the influence of attention in the formation and the refinement of
these representations. I'm now investigating the mechanisms of **action
selection** through the modeling of the basal ganglia complex with a special
emphasis on the motor cortex. The challenge in all these modelling approaches
is to understand how a consistent behavior emerges from a purely distributed,
asynchronous, numerical and adaptive computing, i.e. without any form of a
central supervisor or homonculus, not even a soft one like a central clock.

Embodied Cognition
==================

One important aspect of my research is to consider the brain and the body as a
whole. The brain does not live outside the body. If we aim at understanding
brain and cognition, we cannot do so without considering the brain-body
complex. "*Minds are not disembodied logical reasoning devices.*" as Andy Clark
explained.

Distributed, Asynchronous, Numerical, Adaptive Computing
========================================================

Computational models of the brain exist at several different levels of
description, from the very precise modelling of a unique spiking neuron, taking
into account ion channels and/or dendrites spatial geometry, up to the
modelling of very large assemblies of neuron that express complex dynamic
interactions. I'm interested in a mesoscopic approach of the brain where the
computational paradigm is grounded on the notion of a unit that is essentially
a set of time dependent values varying under the influence of other units via
adaptive weighted connections. The evolution of the units' value and weights
are simply defined by a set of differential equations. This is a strongly
constrained framework that has been designed such as to avoid any modeling
artifact like a central supervisor or a homunculus. If some properties are to
emerge from our models, we want to make sure they are properties of the model
as opposed to properties of the software that run the simulation.

Computer Graphics
=================

As a side-effect of my research in distributed computing, I've come to to
consider GPU computing to speed-up computations. However, I became quickly
mostly interested in the parallel you can draw between adaptive distributed
computing and fragment-shader programming. The many ways to achieve a global
scene effect from a single shader program brings interesting insights to the
problem of emergence.
